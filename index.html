        <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>

CS1950-E is a seminar course on Human-Robot Interaction. The theme of this course this fall is going to be "Creating usability interactive maps from Robot sensing". We will introduce you to the perceptual problems and challenges involved in robotics. In the process you will be going through some basics in robot sensing (from Odometry, Lasers, RGBD Sensors and Camera), mapping and state estimation problems like localization and SLAM. We will essentially discuss conference papers covering 4 topics such as 1) Smoothing RGBD data from Kinect, 2) RGBD Mapping, 3) History of SLAM in robotics (EKF, SGD, FastSLAM) and 4) Optimization techniques used in mapping and SLAM (iSAM, ICP). This course focuses on SLAM part of robotics and how human interaction on these maps would help in building better maps. 
Below are some of the recent research developments on these topics for your motivation.

<!--We answer this question through a series of lectures, class discussions, and group projects. -->
<p>
This year, CS1950-E course work will involve each individual discussing atleast one paper during the entire semester (ofcourse Faculty/TA will help you understand the technical details) and assignments will be to implement some standard techniques in each of the above mentioned topics. There will be a final project of implementing something substantial out of your assignments. 
<!--These projects will explore various approaches to robot decision making (spanning reaction to deliberation), perception (basic object recognition and state estimation), and control (proportional-derivative servos). -->

<b>UPDATED:</b> from incorrect pointer to Fall 2011 mailing list

<h2>Prerequisites</h2> 

<p>
Highly Recommended: Linear alegebra
<br>
Recommended: Computer graphics, Computer vision, AI

I will do my best to cover the necessary material, but no guarantees. Computer vision and AI share common concepts with this course.

<h2>Textbook</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://www.probabilistic-robotics.org/"><b>Probabilistic Robotics</b></a>
<br>
Wolfram Burgard, Dieter Fox, and Sebastian Thrun

<h3>Optional texts</h3>
<p><b>TBD</b>

<h2>List of papers covered in the course</h2>

</br>

<h2>Projects and Grading</h2>

<p>
There will be 4 programming assignments and 1 main project.  CS 1950E projects are graded as “checked” (completed) or “not checked” (incomplete). To receive an A grade in the course, you must have all assignments checked by the end of reading period. For a B grade, 3 assignments must be checked. Less than 3 checks will result in no credit for the course.  The timing and due dates for these projects will be announced on an ongoing basis.

<!--Git repositories will be used for project implementation, version control, and submission. Project implementations are submitted as branches in your assigned repository. These branches must be submitted prior to the due date for each assignment. Your implementation will be checked out and executed by the course staff. You will be notified by the course staff whether your implementation is sufficient for checking off the assignment. If your assignment is insufficient for receiving a check, your group is allowed one regrade (per assignment) with 2 weeks of notification. If deemed necessary, the course staff may require an interactive demonstration of your implementation and/or a web-based written report. -->

<h3>Final Grading</h3>

All grading will be finalized on <b>TBA</b>.  Regrading of specific assignments will be done upon request during office hours.  No regrading will be done after grades are finalized.

<h3>Repositories</h3>

<p>
The course staff will provide a git repository (through github) for each student group to check in project source code and reports, unless you request using separate service or repository. Please refer to <a href="http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~blynn/gitmagic/">this tutorial</a> for an in-depth introduction to git and version control.  Although it has a coarse language choice, this is also a great and accessible <a href="http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/">tutorial<a>.  We expect students to use these repositories for collaborative development as well as project submission. It is the responsibility of each student group to ensure their repository adheres to the Collaboration Policy and submission standards for each assignment. Submission standards and examples will be described for each assignment.

<h3>Late Policy</h3>
<p>
Do not be late submitting assignments. The course staff reserves the right to not grade late submissions.  

<h3>200-Level Credit</h3>
<p>
CS1950E can be taken for 200-level (graduate) credit.  For 200-level credit, a grad of A must be earned. <b>TBD</b>

<h2>Collaboration Policy</h2>
<p>
<b>TBD</b>
 This policy covers all course material and assignments unless otherwise stated. Course material and Turtlebot/ROS information and documentation may be discussed with anyone. Course material does not include assignment handouts. Assignments may be discussed with the other cs1950E students. Discussions may make use of a whiteboard or paper. Discussions outside of your group cannot include writing or debugging code on a computer. You may take notes away from these discussions, provided these notes do not include any source code.

The code for your implementation may not be shown to anyone outside of your group, including granting access to repositories or careless lack of protection. You do not need to hide the screen from anyone, but you should not attempt to show anyone your code. When you are done using any robot device such that another group may use it, you must remove all code you have put onto the device. You may not share your code with others outside of your group. At any time, you may show others the implemented program running on a device or simulator, but you may not discuss specific debugging details about your code while doing so.

Should you fail to abide by this policy, you will receive no credit for this course. Brown also reserves the right to pursue any means necessary to ensure compliance. This includes, but is not limited to prosecution through Brown University’s Student Conduct Procedures, which can result in your suspension or expulsion from the University
