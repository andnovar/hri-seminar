        <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>

CS1950-E is a seminar course on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). The theme of the HRI Seminar in Fall 2014 is "Building Human-usable 3D Map for Robots".  Consider how interactive 2D maps of the world have become commonplace, almost essential, in our daily lives.  Map services from companies such as Mapquest, Google, Apple, etc. are used in many different ways to help our decision making about where to go, where to shop, where to live, and a plethora of our activities.  Maps from these services contain not only physical descriptions of space (such as geospatial locations, metric geographic terrain, street views) but also important semantic information (navigation graphs, directory labels, ratings).  Such maps are also the basis for autonomous decision making for advising people as well as for robot control.  For example, route directions provided by a mapping service between locations is generated by a planner that searches for optimal paths in the map.  Similarly, a robot will use a planner on a map to autonomously move across the locations in a building.  However, this requires a map building phase followed by a labeling phase and then a planning phase. Building on advances in depth sensing technologies, we will focus on building maps using Red-Green-Blue-Depth (RGBD) sensors, such as the Microsoft Kinect, followed by interactively labeling these maps so that they can be used to plan and execute a task by robots such as the Willow Garage PR2. 
<p>

This course focuses on SLAM part of robotics and how human interaction on these maps would help in building better maps.  We will cover topics that address the perceptual challenges involved in robotics for estimating 3D maps. The course will go over basic concepts in robot sensing (from odometry, laser rangefinding, RGBD sensors and cameras) and robot mapping and state estimation (including Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, or SLAM).  We will additionally cover new exploratory ideas for semantic labeling of maps through recent publications in robot learning from demonstration, semantic mapping, geometry sketching, etc.  We will essentially discuss research papers covering the following areas:

<ul> 
<li> Smoothing RGBD data from Kinect, 
</li>
<li> Basic RGBD Mapping, 
</li>
<li> SLAM and mapping methods in robotics (SGD, iSAM, FastSLAM, EKF, ICP) 
</li>
<li> Human-in-the-loop map building and labeling </b>. 
</li>
</ul>


<!--We answer this question through a series of lectures, class discussions, and group projects. -->
<p>
This year, CS1950-E course work will involve each individual in the class:

<ul>
<li> presenting at least two papers during the entire semester (of course, the course staff will help you understand the technical details),
</li>
<li> completing 4 programming assignments building up to 3D RGBD mapping, 
</li>
<li> developing and implementing a final project to involving a human-usable interface to a build map
</li>
</ul>

<!--These projects will explore various approaches to robot decision making (spanning reaction to deliberation), perception (basic object recognition and state estimation), and control (proportional-derivative servos). -->

<h2>Projects and Grading</h2>

<p>
There will be 4 programming projects and 1 final main project.  CS 1950E projects are graded as “checked” (completed) or “not checked” (incomplete). To receive an A grade in the course, you must have all 5 projects checked by the end of reading period. For a B grade, 4 programming projects must be checked. Less than 3 checks will result in no credit for the course.  The timing and due dates for these projects will be announced on an ongoing basis.
</br>

All the project deadlines will have a demo by the students in the lab session. Final project will also require a presentation by students regarding the various methods they studied and employed. Additional results with additional maps

<!--Git repositories will be used for project implementation, version control, and submission. Project implementations are submitted as branches in your assigned repository. These branches must be submitted prior to the due date for each assignment. Your implementation will be checked out and executed by the course staff. You will be notified by the course staff whether your implementation is sufficient for checking off the assignment. If your assignment is insufficient for receiving a check, your group is allowed one regrade (per assignment) with 2 weeks of notification. If deemed necessary, the course staff may require an interactive demonstration of your implementation and/or a web-based written report. -->

<h3>Final Grading</h3>

All grading will be finalized on <b>TBA</b>.  Regrading of specific assignments will be done upon request during office hours.  No regrading will be done after grades are finalized.

<h3>Repositories</h3>

<p>
The course staff will provide a git repository (through github) for each student group to check in project source code and reports, unless you request using separate service or repository. Please refer to <a href="http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~blynn/gitmagic/">this tutorial</a> for an in-depth introduction to git and version control.  Although it has a coarse language choice, this is also a great and accessible <a href="http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/">tutorial<a>.  We expect students to use these repositories for collaborative development as well as project submission. It is the responsibility of each student group to ensure their repository adheres to the Collaboration Policy and submission standards for each assignment. Submission standards and examples will be described for each assignment.

<h3>Late Policy</h3>
<p>
Do not be late submitting assignments. The course staff reserves the right to not grade late submissions.  

<h3>200-Level Credit</h3>
<p>
CS1950E can be taken for 200-level (graduate) credit.  For 200-level credit, a grad of A must be earned. <b>TBD</b>

<h2>Collaboration Policy</h2>
<p>
<b>TBD</b>
 This policy covers all course material and assignments unless otherwise stated. Course material and Turtlebot/ROS information and documentation may be discussed with anyone. Course material does not include assignment handouts. Assignments may be discussed with the other cs1950E students. Discussions may make use of a whiteboard or paper. Discussions outside of your group cannot include writing or debugging code on a computer. You may take notes away from these discussions, provided these notes do not include any source code.

The code for your implementation may not be shown to anyone outside of your group, including granting access to repositories or careless lack of protection. You do not need to hide the screen from anyone, but you should not attempt to show anyone your code. When you are done using any robot device such that another group may use it, you must remove all code you have put onto the device. You may not share your code with others outside of your group. At any time, you may show others the implemented program running on a device or simulator, but you may not discuss specific debugging details about your code while doing so.

Should you fail to abide by this policy, you will receive no credit for this course. Brown also reserves the right to pursue any means necessary to ensure compliance. This includes, but is not limited to prosecution through Brown University’s Student Conduct Procedures, which can result in your suspension or expulsion from the University
